# I am Owen Claxton
An engineer with a deep passion for robots, rockets, and research. I thrive on challenges, and have an insatiable drive to push the boundaries of what is possible. My educational journey has armed me with:
1. Bachelor of Engineering, Honours in Aerospace/Electrical (First-Class)
2. Bachelor of Science in Physics (Distinction)
3. Graduate Certificate in Space Studies

I started my studies at the QUT (Queensland University of Technology), who, along with the Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith Fund, sponsored me to participate in the 2022 International Space University + University of South Australia Southern Hemisphere Space Studies Program. From there, I studied some more space engineering courses at the University of Sydney, before commencing my New Colombo Plan (NCP) scholarship to the Republic of Korea (RoK). Throughout my degrees, I had the privilege to take on a series of Executive roles with the QUT Mechanical Engineering Student Society (MESS) and the QUT Aerospace Society including senior positions such as Vice President and Secretary. Due to my academic successes, I was invited to join the QUT College of Excellence and the QUT Dean's Scholars. I was also able to spend some time with the QUT Entrepreneurship team through their events - and even won a lightning hackathon - as well as the QUT Vacation Research Experience Scheme on two different projects. 

I'm not just a graduate; I'm an entrepreneur at heart, always seeking innovative solutions and eager to contribute to groundbreaking projects. My commitment to excellence and my strong communication skills, combined with the fearlessness to tackle complex challenges, have shaped my journey. I am goal-oriented and driven by a relentless determination to achieve positive outcomes. With a healthy dose of optimism, a hunger for life-long learning, and a flexible approach to problem-solving, I'm ready to make a significant impact in any position or environment. My academic accolades, practical experience, and technical proficiency are all testament to my dedication to advancing in the fields of science and engineering. Join me on this journey of exploration and innovation as I strive to leave my mark on the realms of robotics, space exploration, quantum physics, or beyond.
